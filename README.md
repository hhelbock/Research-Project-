This is the denoise transformer that I wrote for my reseach project 
It is the base model that I wrote. My research project compared different hidden layers. I did this by changing the d_model of the transformer and the related parted inside the module I made. I expreimented with 7,14,21, and 28 dimensions. This is only the base model with 7.
